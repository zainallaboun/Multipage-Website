                     <td><a> This is the light blue lululemon align tank. This tank is quite versatile and is an essential for teens. It is flattering and can be dressed up and down. Although lululemon is an athletic wear brand, the align tanks are suitable for many occasions. This can be worn during walks or can be worn on a daily basis when running errands. This top can be paired with various pants such as flared leggings, biker shorts and mini tennis skirts. The low neckline makes this top perfect for longer necklaces. Make sure to pair it with a dainty necklace in order to remain elegant and bring attention to the top itself. </a></td>

                    <td><a> This is the Christian Dior sheer black tank top. This is a little bit more edgy and can be worn with leather in order to accentuate the edginess. For example, wearing a loose fitting leather jacket with a cutout similar to that of a blazer will elevate this top. Additionally, it can be worn on top of another top for a summery yet more modest look.</a></td>

                    <td><a> This top is from the 1947 dior collection. It is super rare to find and is quite a beautiful piece. One can dress this shirt down by pairing it with sneakers and flared jeans for an 80's inspired look or can dress it up with a midi skirt and platform, open-toed heels. </a></td>
